These days, artificial intelligence is a buzzword we see everywhere. According to some, AI is poised to put humans out of their jobs, and ready to solve all major social problems. The concept of AI is used to designate so many different processes, systems, devices, and ideas that it almost loses any real meaning. What is behind this buzzword and the so- called intelligent technologies and their functions? How do our historical and cultural legacies affect our understanding, hopes, and projections for the future of AI? The four-day intensive course at Palacký University in Olomouc tackles these questions and many more, giving an interdisciplinary and diverse overview of the main theories, paradigms and discourses at the intersection of technology, society, and language.

... humanity's Other, and defines the repositories of normativity
... the human mirror, as a metaphor for making sense of the world
